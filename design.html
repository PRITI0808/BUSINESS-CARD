			<p class="entry-byline meta">The horse is a domesticated, one-toed, hoofed mammal. It belongs to the taxonomic 
                family Equidae and is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55
                 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large, single-toed animal of today.
                  Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BCE, and their domestication is believed to have been 
                  widespread by 3000 BCE. Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated 
                  populations live in the wild as feral horses. These feral populations are not true wild horses, as this 
                  term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated. There is an extensive, specialized 
                  vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, 
                  size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior."</p>

		<p class="entry-summary">Horses are adapted to run, allowing them to quickly escape predators, and possess an 
            excellent sense of balance and a strong fight-or-flight response. Related to this need to flee from predators 
            in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down, with younger horses
             tending to sleep significantly more than adults.[4] Female horses, called mares, carry their young for 
             approximately 11 months and a young horse, called a foal, can stand and run shortly following birth. Most 
             domesticated horses begin training under a saddle or in a harness between the ages of two and four. 
             They reach full adult development by age five, and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years.</p>

		<p class="entry-summary">Horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament: spirited 
            "hot bloods" with speed and endurance; "cold bloods", such as draft horses and some ponies, suitable for slow, heavy work;
             and "warmbloods", developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, often focusing on creating breeds for 
             specific riding purposes, particularly in Europe. There are more than 300 breeds of horse in the world today, developed 
             for many different uses..</p>
